CHECK Data Models

CHECK User
  fb_id
  meetup_id
  linkedin_id
  email
  first_name
  last_name
  picture_url
  facebook_access_token
  facebook_expires_at

Use Koala so
<!--   if current_user gets me/events before the page loads CHECK
 -->
 <!-- Make toggle function to click off the event -->
  Interpolate the about me to add text!!!

<!-- Should make it so user can RSVP to events to add them to list
  half way there changed scope
 --><!-- Should make it so click instead of hover displays name
 -->
 Add permissions check to Koala
var me3 = IN.API.Profile("me").result(displayProfiles);
me3.storedSuccessResults.values[0]["id"]
<!--
Figure out why the events invited/not replied to is so slow -->

<!-- why doesnt the text toggle locally? Don't want to break the thing.
 -->

As "Motherfucking James Bond 007"
  I'd like to be able to create an account for the Dossier App
  So I can use the app

  I'd like to be able to login with fb
  So I can see my event lists

  I'd like to be able to login with linkedIn
  So I can see my event lists

  I'd like to be able to login with Meetup
  So I can see my event lists

  I'd then like to be able to choose a list
  So I can see the other attendees in a more detailed list

  I'd like to see the detailed list
  so I can see names and faces of the attendee

  If I click on an attendee
  I want to know details of the person like Name/Job/School

  If I launch memorize mode
  I want to be able to toggle the persons info so I can memorize their details (i.e. Name)
