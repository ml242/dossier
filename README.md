 <!-- Make toggle function to click off the event -->
Interpolate the about me to add text!!!

Should make it so user can RSVP to events to add them to list

 Add permissions check to Koala

 Add location functionality
  Add Foursquare API see who is coming, who is confirmed


As "Motherfucking James Bond 007"
  I'd like to be able to create an account for the Dossier App
  So I can use the app

  I'd like to be able to login with fb
  So I can see my event lists

  I'd like to be able to login with linkedIn
  So I can see my event lists

  I'd like to be able to login with Meetup
  So I can see my event lists

  I'd then like to be able to choose a list
  So I can see the other attendees in a more detailed list

  I'd like to see the detailed list
  so I can see names and faces of the attendee

  If I click on an attendee
  I want to know details of the person like Name/Job/School

  If I launch memorize mode
  I want to be able to toggle the persons info so I can memorize their details (i.e. Name)
