As "Motherfucking James Bond 007"
  I'd like to be able to create an account for the Dossier App
  So I can use the app

  I'd like to be able to login with fb
  So I can see my event lists

  I'd like to be able to login with linkedIn
  So I can see my event lists

  I'd like to be able to login with Meetup
  So I can see my event lists

  I'd then like to be able to choose a list
  So I can see the other attendees in a more detailed list

  I'd like to see the detailed list
  so I can see names and faces of the attendee

  If I click on an attendee
  I want to know details of the person like Name/Job/School

  If I launch memorize mode
  I want to be able to toggle the persons info so I can memorize their details (i.e. Name)
